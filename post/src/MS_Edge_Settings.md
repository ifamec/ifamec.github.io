# MS Edge Settings

post @ 2021-01-19

Microsoft Edge is good except some settings hiding always so deep. Take down some notes for future reference.

> Microsoft Edge - Version 88.0.705.50

**copy hyperlink by default** COMES TO macOS FINALLY ðŸ˜­. SAME APPROACH TO REVERT (CHECK No.2 BELOW)


> Microsoft Edge - Version 87.0.664.75

1. **Change Search Engine**
    - Settings
    - Privacy, Search, and Service
    - **SCROLL TO BOTTOM** Address bar and search
    - CHANGE default search engine

2. Edge in **Windows** will copy hyperlink by default, which is annoying to somebody, at least me. To revert to copy
   plain text by default:
    - Settings
    - Share, copy, and paste
    - SELECT `Plain text`
    - ~~PS: DO NOT COME TO MAC VERSION !!!~~

WILL UPDATE MORE OR CORRECT IF CHANGES IN FUTURE VERSION
